<h1> A quick guide for this repository </h1>

<h3>What is this reporitory about?</h3>


<h3>For it to work properly</h3>
First, it is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to prevent any future confusion in the computer. 
Now, for the server in python (v 3.11) we need to install these libraries:
<ul>
  <il><code>opencv-python==4.9.0.80</code><br></il>
  <il><code>numpy==1.24.4</code><br></il>
  <il><code>ultralytics==8.2.15</code><br></il>
  <il><code>agentpy</code><br></il>
</ul>

Covered that, for Unity (editor 6000.0.27f1), so that the simulation can run properly, we will need these packages:
- AI Navigation
- Burst
- Collections
- Core RP Library
- Custom NUnity
- Input System
- JetBrains Rider Editor
- Mathematics
- Mono Cecil
- Multiplayer Center
- Performance testing API
- Searcher
- Shader Graph
- Test Framework
- Timeline
- Unity Light Transport Library
- Unity UI
- Universal RP
- Universal RP Config
- Version Control
- Visual Scripting
- Visual Studio Editor


And these libraries previoulsy installed:
- UnityEngine
- System.Collections
- System.Net.Sockets
- System.Text
- System.Collections.Generic
-Â System.Linq


<h3>To run it...</h3>
As an initial step, it is essential to run the server.py, via <code>python server.py</code> (note that we need to be on the same folder), or we could just hit the run button on the IDE of our election.
For the Unity simulation we have to possibilities:
<ul>
  <il>1. To run it from Unity, with the play button<br></il>
  <il>2. To execute the app, called <code>UnityAgentesVisionComputacional.exe</code>, in the folder 'JuegoCompilado'</il>
</ul>

Happy codding!
