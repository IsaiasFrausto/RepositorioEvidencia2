<h3>What is this reporitory about?</h3>


<h3>For it to work properly</h3>
First, it is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to prevent any future confusion in the computer. 
Now, for the server in python (v 3.11) we need to install these libraries:
<ul>
  <il><code>opencv-python==4.9.0.80</code></il>
  <il><code>numpy==1.24.4</code></il>
  <il><code>ultralytics==8.2.15</code></il>
  <il><code>agentpy</code></il>
</ul>

Covered that, for Unity 6 (editor 6000.0.27f1) we will need these libraries:
          NEED TO ADD THEM

<h3>To run it...</h3>
As an initial step, it is essential to run the server.py, via <code>python server.py</code> (note that we need to be on the same folder), or we could just hit the run button on the IDE of our election.
For the Unity simulation we have to possibilities:
<ul>
  <il>1. To run it from Unity, with the play button</il>
  <il>2. To execute the app, called <code>UnityAgentesVisionComputacional.exe</code>, in the folder 'JuegoCompilado'</il>
</ul>

Happy codding!
